		<h3 class="boxed">Featured Editor's Review for June: UltraDefrag</h3>
		
		<!-- Insert First headline copy here -->
		<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/ultradefrag/">UltraDefrag</a>, is a disk defragmenter for Windows, 
		which supports defragmentation of locked system files by running during the boot process. 
		It is easy to use without any complicated scripting or a huge load of configuration settings. 
		You can filter the files processed by size, number of fragments, file name and path. 
		You can terminate the process early by specifying an execution time limit.
		<br>
		Some Features:
		<ul>
			<li>Boot Time Defragmentation for system file processing</li>
			<li>Console interface for batch processing or setting up scheduled tasks</li>
			<li>Graphical user interface to follow the process visually</li>
			<li>Process single files, folders or drives from the Explorer context menu</li></span>
		</ul>
		UltraDefrag can defragment both FAT and NTFS disks with just a couple of restrictions:
		<ul>
			<li>It cannot defragment FAT directories, because their first clusters are immovable.</li>
			<li>It cannot defragment master file tables (MFT), because their first 16 clusters are immovable.</li>
		</ul>
		However, the program tries to optimize those files placing their fragments close to each other behind the first one.
		UltraDefrag can be used on Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7 and Windows 8. 
		<br>
		Elder versions of the program (prior to v7) can be used on Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 as well, with some limitations.  
		Additionally, <a href="http://jp-andre.pagesperso-orange.fr/advanced-ntfs-3g.html">UltraDefrag for Linux</a> 
		exists which is an independent port of the program based on NTFS-3G capabilities.

		<strong>The Importance of Picking the Right Open Source Community</strong></a><!-- Insert Sponsor Title here -->
		<br>
		<!-- Insert copy here -->
        In choosing a project to work on, there are many things you need to consider. You have to consider if the project is one you are genuinely interested in and use. 
		You have to consider its reputation and track record. And you have to consider the technical aspects like features and frameworks.
		<br><br>
		Beyond these things however, there is one thing you need to consider most of all and that is the community. But why is this so?
		<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Basic Significance</strong><!--Insert title here -->
		<br>
		<!-- Insert copy here -->
        The most basic reason why it's important to choose your projects based on the community is that your contributions will 
		all be for naught if the community doesn't really welcome them. As passionate as you may be about a project, and as robust 
		as a project may be, any participation you have in it will turn void if you are treated as an unwelcome intruder.
		<br><br>
		This does not mean however, that a red carpet must be rolled out for you every time you make a suggestion or contribution. 
		Different projects have different cultures and different ways of welcoming entrants. Some are open to a variety of contributions, 
		while others are more restrictive and hold high standards to every subscriber whether new or old. 
		Most would prefer the former, though some who are up for a challenge may prefer the latter. As the famous saying goes, 
		"different strokes for different folks." In the end, what is essential is that you feel part of the community.
